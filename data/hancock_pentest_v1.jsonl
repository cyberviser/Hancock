Systemd is a system and service manager commonly used for managing background daemon processes (also known as services) and other system resources.(Citation: Linux man-pages: systemd January 2014) Systemd is the default initialization (init) system on many Linux distributions replacing legacy init systems, including SysVinit and Upstart, while remaining backwards compatible.  \n\nSystemd utilizes unit configuration files with the `.service` file extension to encode information about a service's process. By default, system level unit files are stored in the `/systemd/system` directory of the root owned directories (`/`). User level unit files are stored in the `/systemd/user` directories of the user owned directories (`$HOME`).(Citation: lambert systemd 2022) \n\nInside the `.service` unit files, the following directives are used to execute commands:(Citation: freedesktop systemd.service)  \n\n* `ExecStart`, `ExecStartPre`, and `ExecStartPost` directives execute when a service is started manually by `systemctl` or on system start if the service is set to automatically start.\n\n\n**Mitigation approach:**\n- Apply least-privilege principles to limit blast radius\n- Enable detailed logging and forward to SIEM\n- Implement EDR/XDR with behavioral detection\n- Refer to MITRE ATT&CK mitigations: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/002/"}]}

Prioritize patching within your standard SLA for high-severity issues (typically 7–14 days).\n\n**Remediation Steps:**\n1. Check vendor security advisories for the affected software\n2. Apply the official patch or update to a non-vulnerable version\n3. If patching is not immediately possible, apply vendor-recommended workarounds\n4. Verify patch application and re-scan to confirm resolution\n5.
