            "**Breach Communication Strategy — CISO/Executive Playbook**\n\n"
            "**Key Principle:** How you communicate a breach matters almost as much as the breach itself. "
            "Equifax lost $5B in market cap after its 2017 breach — but the poor communication made it worse.\n\n"
            "## The Communication Decision Framework\n\n"
            "**Before you communicate, confirm:**\n"
            "- Scope: what data, how many people, what time period?\n"
            "- Legal: what notifications are legally required? (GDPR 72h, HIPAA, CCPA, state laws)\n"
            "- Forensics: is the attacker still in the environment?\n"
            "- Remediation: have you closed the gap or are you still vulnerable?\n\n"
            "**Rule:** Don't issue a communication you'll have to correct. But don't delay legally required notifications.\n\n"
            "## Notification Hierarchy\n\n"
            "1. **Regulators first** (where required) — GDPR: 72h; HIPAA: 60 days\n"
            "2. **Law enforcement** — FBI, CISA (optional but recommended)\n"
            "3. **Board/executives** — before external notifications go out\n"
            "4. **Affected individuals** — with clear, actionable information\n"
            "5. **Customers/public** — coordinated with #4\n"
            "6. **Media** — reactive only; don't issue a press release proactively unless legally required or story is breaking\n\n"
            "## Customer Notification Best Practices\n\n"
            "**DO:**\n"
            "- Be direct: 'We had a data breach.'\n"
            "- State clearly: what data was exposed, who is affected\n"
            "- Provide specific actions customers should take: change password, monitor credit\n"
            "- Offer free credit monitoring for financial/SSN exposure\n"
            "- Establish a dedicated support hotline\n"
            "- Explain what you're doing to prevent recurrence\n\n"
            "**DON'T:**\n"
            "- Use passive voice: 'Data may have been accessed' — be direct\n"
            "- Bury the breach in legal boilerplate\n"
            "- Minimize: 'Only 6 million records' is not reassuring\n"
            "- Communicate before legal review\n"
            "- Over-promise on future security ('this will never happen again')\n\n"
