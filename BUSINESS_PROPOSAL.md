# 🛡️ CyberViser — The Mission

## Build the Defining Cybersecurity Intelligence Company of the Next Decade

---

## Our Mission

**Become the global standard for AI-powered cybersecurity — the company every organization on Earth trusts to defend their digital infrastructure.**

CyberViser exists to solve the most critical workforce crisis in technology: the **3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs** threatening every business, government, and critical infrastructure system on the planet. We don't fill seats — we **eliminate the need for them** by building autonomous AI security agents that outperform human teams at machine speed.

Hancock is the first product. CyberViser is the platform. The Fortune 500 is the destination.

## The $500B Problem We Own

Cybersecurity is not a nice-to-have — it is existential infrastructure. Every company is a target. Every breach is a business-ending event. And there are nowhere near enough humans to defend the perimeter.

| Crisis | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| **Unfilled security jobs worldwide** | 3.5 million |
| **Average cost of a data breach** | $4.88M (IBM, 2024) |
| **Alerts ignored daily by SOC teams** | 45% — nearly half go uninvestigated |
| **Average pentest engagement cost** | $15,000–$50,000 |
| **Time from breach to detection** | 204 days average |
| **Global cybercrime damage (2025)** | $10.5 trillion annually |

The market isn't asking for incremental improvement. It's screaming for a paradigm shift. **We are that shift.**

## The Hancock Platform

Hancock is a **multi-modal autonomous security agent** — not a chatbot with a security prompt. It is purpose-built, fine-tuned on real threat intelligence, and deployable anywhere from a laptop to a sovereign cloud.

### 🔴 Offensive Security Engine
Automated penetration testing guidance, attack path analysis, CVE exploitation chains, and professional report generation. Trained on MITRE ATT&CK, NVD/CVE, CISA KEV, and Atomic Red Team datasets.

### 🔵 Defensive Operations Engine
Real-time alert triage, SIEM query generation (Splunk, Elastic, Sentinel), incident response playbooks (PICERL), threat hunting, detection engineering (Sigma/YARA), and IOC enrichment.

### 👔 Executive Intelligence Engine
Board-ready risk reporting, compliance automation (SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST CSF, CMMC, FedRAMP), security program roadmaps, budget justification models, and M&A security due diligence.

### 🛡️ Code Security Engine
Real-time code review for vulnerabilities, SAST/DAST augmentation, supply chain risk analysis (GHSA), and secure development lifecycle integration.

## Total Addressable Market: $500B+ by 2030

We are not competing for a slice. We are building the platform that consolidates fragmented security tooling into a single intelligence layer.

| Segment | 2025 Size | 2030 Projected | CAGR |
|---------|-----------|---------------|------|
| Global Cybersecurity Market | $217B | $425B | 12.3% |
| AI in Cybersecurity | $38.2B | $134B | 21.9% |
| Managed Security Services | $46.4B | $95B | 15.8% |
| Penetration Testing | $4.5B | $9.8B | 13.7% |
| GRC & Compliance | $52B | $110B | 16.2% |
| Application Security | $12.8B | $30B | 18.5% |

**Our wedge:** Enterprises currently spend $200K–$2M/year across 15–30 disconnected security tools. Hancock replaces or augments the majority of them through a single AI-native platform.

---

## Revenue Architecture — Path to $10B+

### Layer 1 — Open Source Ecosystem (Free)
The growth engine. MIT-licensed core drives adoption, community trust, developer mindshare, and a global talent pipeline. Every open source user is a future enterprise buyer or champion.

### Layer 2 — Hancock Pro ($499/month per seat)
Managed cloud, advanced models, extended context, priority SLA, RBAC, SSO, audit logging. Target: individual security teams and consultancies.

### Layer 3 — Hancock Enterprise ($50K–$500K/year)
On-premise/private cloud, custom fine-tuning on client's proprietary threat data, dedicated model instances, SIEM/SOAR/GRC integrations, professional services. Target: Fortune 1000, government, defense, critical infrastructure.

### Layer 4 — Hancock Platform (Usage-Based)
API marketplace at $0.008–$0.05/request for developers embedding security intelligence into their own products. Listed on AWS, Azure, GCP, and NVIDIA NIM marketplaces.

### Layer 5 — CyberViser Intelligence Network (Data Flywheel)
Aggregated, anonymized threat telemetry from the deployed base creates a proprietary threat intelligence feed — monetized as a premium subscription and competitive moat that deepens with every customer.

**Revenue projection:**

| Year | ARR Target | Customers | Milestone |
|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Year 1 | $1M | 50 | Product-market fit, Series A |
| Year 2 | $10M | 300 | Category leader, Series B |
| Year 3 | $50M | 1,500 | Market dominance, Series C |
| Year 5 | $250M | 8,000 | IPO-ready |
| Year 7 | $1B | 25,000 | Public company |
| Year 10 | $5B+ | 100,000+ | Fortune 500 |

## Competitive Domination Strategy

We don't compete — we make competitors irrelevant by collapsing their entire category into a feature of our platform.

| Incumbent | Their Revenue | What They Do | How We Win |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| CrowdStrike | $3.4B | EDR/XDR | We add AI-native triage + hunt on top of any EDR |
| Palo Alto Networks | $6.9B | Network security | We become the intelligence layer their firewalls feed |
| Microsoft Security | $20B | Bundled enterprise | We're open, specialized, and 10x cheaper |
| Rapid7 / Tenable | $2B combined | Vuln management | We automate what their scanners only detect |
| Splunk (Cisco) | $3.8B | SIEM | We generate the queries their analysts can't write |

**Five structural advantages no incumbent can replicate:**

1. **Purpose-built AI** — fine-tuned on curated security datasets, not a general LLM with a system prompt
2. **Deploy anywhere** — laptop, air-gapped network, sovereign cloud, or our managed platform
3. **Open source trust** — security teams will never trust a black box; transparency is our moat
4. **Full-spectrum coverage** — offense + defense + executive + code in one agent
5. **Data flywheel** — every deployment makes the models smarter; network effects compound

1. **Timing is perfect.** The LLM revolution hit in 2023. Enterprise adoption is 2025–2027. We are building the category-defining product at exactly the right moment.

2. **The talent crisis is permanent.** There will never be enough human security analysts. AI is the only path forward. We are the AI.

3. **Open source is the distribution strategy.** Every security professional who touches Hancock becomes an evangelist. Trust is earned through transparency.

4. **The data flywheel is a monopoly machine.** Every deployment feeds the model. Every model improvement drives more deployments. This compounds forever.

5. **We are building a platform, not a feature.** Point tools get acquired. Platforms become Fortune 500 companies.
