# 🛡️ CyberViser — Hancock AI Security Platform
## Business Proposal & Go-to-Market Strategy

---

## Executive Summary

**CyberViser** is developing **Hancock**, an AI-powered cybersecurity agent that automates the work of penetration testers, SOC analysts, and CISOs through specialized large language models (LLMs). Built on a fine-tuned Mistral 7B backbone using NVIDIA NIM infrastructure, Hancock delivers expert-level security guidance via a simple REST API — deployable in any environment.

The cybersecurity talent shortage is at a crisis point: there are **3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs globally** (Cybersecurity Ventures, 2025). Hancock doesn't replace security professionals — it **multiplies them**, enabling lean teams to operate at enterprise scale.

---

## The Problem

| Challenge | Reality |
|-----------|---------|
| **Talent shortage** | 3.5M unfilled security roles globally |
| **Alert fatigue** | SOC analysts process 1,000+ alerts/day; 45% go uninvestigated |
| **Pentest cost** | Avg. pentest costs $15,000–$50,000 per engagement |
| **Skill gap** | Junior analysts lack institutional knowledge for complex incidents |
| **Speed** | Manual triage takes hours; breaches happen in minutes |

---

## The Solution: Hancock

Hancock is a **multi-modal AI security agent** that operates in three specialist modes:

### 🔴 Pentest Mode
Automated offensive security guidance — recon, exploitation paths, CVE analysis, and professional report generation. Powered by MITRE ATT&CK and NVD/CVE fine-tuning.

### 🔵 SOC Analyst Mode
Real-time alert triage, SIEM query generation (Splunk SPL, Elastic KQL, Sentinel KQL), incident response playbooks (PICERL), threat hunting, and detection engineering (Sigma/YARA rules).

### 👔 CISO Strategy Mode
Board-level risk reporting, compliance automation (SOC2, ISO 27001, NIST CSF), security program roadmaps, and executive summaries.

## Market Opportunity

| Segment | Market Size (2025) | CAGR |
|---------|-------------------|------|
| Global Cybersecurity Market | $217B | 12.3% |
| AI in Cybersecurity | $38.2B | 21.9% |
| Managed Security Services | $46.4B | 15.8% |
| Penetration Testing Market | $4.5B | 13.7% |

**Target market:** Mid-market enterprises (200–5,000 employees), MSSPs, security consultancies, and government/defense contractors.

---

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Focus | Weakness vs. Hancock |
|-----------|-------|---------------------|
| Microsoft Copilot for Security | General enterprise | Generic, expensive, cloud-only |
| Google Security AI Workbench | Threat intel | No pentest capability |
| Veracode AI | AppSec only | Narrow scope |
| SentinelAI | EDR-focused | No IR playbooks or hunt logic |
| **Hancock** | **Full-stack security** | **Open, deployable, specialized** |

**Key differentiators:**
1. **Specialized fine-tuning** — not a general LLM with a security prompt
2. **Deployable anywhere** — local, private cloud, or NVIDIA NIM
3. **Open source core** — trust through transparency
4. **Multi-modal** — pentest + SOC + CISO in one agent
5. **NVIDIA NIM native** — fastest path to enterprise GPU inference
