## 🎯 Template 1 — Enterprise MSSP / Security Consultancy

**Subject:** Your SOC analysts are drowning. Hancock fixes that.

Hi [Name],

Your team processes thousands of alerts a day. 45% go uninvestigated. Every missed alert is a potential breach. Every breach costs $4.88M on average.

Hancock is a purpose-built AI security platform — not ChatGPT with a security prompt. It's fine-tuned on MITRE ATT&CK, 200k+ CVEs, CISA KEV, and Atomic Red Team data. One API call gets you:

- **Autonomous alert triage** — severity, MITRE mapping, TP/FP verdict, containment actions
- **Production SIEM queries** — Splunk SPL, Elastic KQL, Sentinel KQL — generated in seconds
- **PICERL incident response playbooks** — full playbook for any incident type, instantly
- **Sigma/YARA rule generation** — detection engineering on demand
- **Offensive security guidance** — recon, CVE analysis, exploitation paths, report generation

Deploys on your infrastructure. Zero data egress. SOC 2 compliant.

We're onboarding 10 design partners for our Enterprise pilot. [Company] is exactly the kind of operation we built this for.

I'd like to offer you a 30-day pilot — no cost, no commitment. Just deploy and measure the impact.

Can we schedule 20 minutes this week?

## 🎯 Template 2 — LinkedIn DM to Security Leader (VP/Director/CISO)

Hi [Name], I've been following [Company]'s security work — your team is doing serious things.

I'm building CyberViser — an AI platform that's replacing the repetitive 80% of SOC and pentest work. Fine-tuned LLMs, not generic chatbots. MITRE ATT&CK native. Deploys anywhere.

We're onboarding enterprise design partners right now. Would love your team's feedback — free pilot, no strings.

5 minutes to deploy: https://cyberviser.ai

## 🎯 Template 3 — Pentest Firm (Decision Maker)

**Subject:** Cut your pentest report writing time by 70%

Hi [Name],

How many hours per engagement does your team spend on report writing, CVE research, and methodology documentation?

Hancock automates the grunt work. It knows MITRE ATT&CK, 200k+ CVEs, CISA KEV, and writes executive summaries, finding descriptions, exploitation paths, and remediation guidance on command.

Your senior operators stay in the terminal. Hancock handles the paper.

It's not a generic AI. It's purpose-built for offensive security — fine-tuned on real pentest knowledge, deployed as a REST API you wire into your existing workflow.

We're working with [X] pentest firms already. Free 30-day pilot available.

## 🎯 Template 4 — Investor / VC Outreach

**Subject:** $2M Seed — AI cybersecurity platform, $500B TAM, Fortune 500 trajectory

Hi [Name],

CyberViser is building the platform that replaces 15–30 disconnected security tools with a single AI-native intelligence layer. We're targeting the $500B cybersecurity market with purpose-built LLMs — not generic AI with a security prompt.

**Why now:** 3.5M unfilled security jobs. $10.5T in annual cybercrime damage. The market is screaming for AI-native security. We're building it.

**Traction:**
- Hancock platform live — 12 security-specific API endpoints (triage, hunt, respond, Sigma, YARA, IOC, CISO advisory)
- Fine-tuned on MITRE ATT&CK + NVD/CVE + CISA KEV + Atomic Red Team + GHSA (5,670 training samples)
- Multi-backend inference: NVIDIA NIM, Groq, Together AI, Ollama
- Python + Node.js SDKs, Docker deployment, CI/CD pipeline
- Enterprise pilot program launching Q2 2026

**The ask:** $2M seed to hire 5 engineers, scale compute, and onboard 10 enterprise design partners. Targeting $1M ARR in 12 months and Series A.

**Competitive edge:** CrowdStrike does EDR. Splunk does SIEM. Palo Alto does network. We collapse all of them into an AI intelligence layer that deploys anywhere — laptop to sovereign cloud.

## 🎯 Template 5 — Strategic Partner (NVIDIA, AWS, Microsoft)

**Subject:** Partnership opportunity — AI-native cybersecurity platform on [Platform]

Hi [Name],

CyberViser is building the first purpose-built AI cybersecurity platform — autonomous security agents fine-tuned on MITRE ATT&CK, CVE, and real threat intelligence data.

We're already running on [NVIDIA NIM / AWS / Azure] and want to explore a deeper partnership:

- **Marketplace listing** — Hancock as a featured AI security solution
- **Co-marketing** — joint case studies, conference presence (Black Hat, RSA, re:Invent)
- **Technical integration** — deep integration with [NIM / SageMaker / Azure AI]
- **Design partner program** — joint go-to-market with your enterprise security customers

We're targeting $1M ARR in Year 1, $10M in Year 2, with a clear path to category leadership.

Would love to connect with your security ISV / partner team.

## 🎯 Template 6 — Government / Defense / FedRAMP

**Subject:** AI-powered cybersecurity agent — air-gapped deployment, NIST-aligned

Hi [Name],

CyberViser's Hancock platform is an AI security agent that runs entirely on-premise — no cloud dependency, no data egress, air-gap compatible.

Built for security teams that need:
- MITRE ATT&CK-mapped alert triage and threat hunting
- Automated incident response playbooks (PICERL)
- NIST CSF / CMMC / FedRAMP compliance automation
- Sigma/YARA detection rule generation

Fine-tuned on public, legally sourced datasets (MITRE, NVD, CISA KEV). No proprietary data in training.

We're pursuing FedRAMP authorization and looking for agency design partners. Would [Agency/Command] be interested in a pilot?

## 🎯 Template 7 — Security Community / Bug Bounty / CTF

Hey [handle],

Built something for people who live in the terminal:

**Hancock** — AI security agent, fine-tuned on MITRE ATT&CK + 200k CVEs + CISA KEV + Atomic Red Team.

Not a wrapper around ChatGPT. Purpose-built for offense and defense:
- Ask about any CVE, technique, or attack path
- Generate Splunk/Elastic/Sentinel hunt queries
- Write Sigma and YARA rules on demand
- Full PICERL incident response playbooks

GitHub: https://github.com/cyberviser/Hancock
Live demo: https://cyberviser.ai/demo

Star it. Break it. PRs welcome.
