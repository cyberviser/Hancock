## 🎯 Template 1 — Cold Email to MSSP / Security Consultancy

**Subject:** AI that writes your Splunk queries and triage reports — free trial

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because [Company] does exactly the kind of work Hancock was built for.

Hancock is an AI security agent (fine-tuned Mistral 7B on MITRE ATT&CK + NVD/CVE) that your team can hit with a single API call and get:

- **Alert triage** — severity, MITRE mapping, TP/FP verdict, containment steps
- **SIEM queries** — production-ready Splunk SPL / Elastic KQL / Sentinel KQL
- **IR playbooks** — full PICERL playbook for any incident type in seconds
- **Pentest mode** — recon, exploitation guidance, CVE analysis

It runs on your infra or ours. No data leaves your environment.

I'd love to set you up with a free trial. No pitch, no sales call required — just hit the API and see if it saves your analysts time.

Worth 5 minutes?

## 🎯 Template 2 — LinkedIn DM to Security Professional

Hi [Name], I saw your work on [post/company/CTF] — impressive stuff.

I've been building Hancock, an AI agent fine-tuned specifically for pentest and SOC work. It generates SIEM queries, triages alerts, and writes PICERL playbooks via a simple REST API.

Just shipped v0.4.0. Would love to get your honest feedback — free access, no strings.

## 🎯 Template 3 — Email to Pentest Firm

**Subject:** Your analysts shouldn't be writing nmap one-liners from memory

Hi [Name],

Quick question: how much time does your team spend on report writing and CVE research per engagement?

Hancock is an AI built for pentest operators — it knows MITRE ATT&CK, 200k+ CVEs, and can write executive summaries, finding descriptions, and exploitation paths on command.

It's not ChatGPT with a security prompt. It's fine-tuned on real pentest data, deployed as a REST API you can wire into your existing workflow.

Free trial available. Takes 5 minutes to set up.
